# SPOTDIAGRAMS

Some Fortran code to do ray tracing through optical telescope systems.

The end results is a spotdiagram: which is a bunble of parallel incoming light rays hitting the focal plane of the telescope. The smaller the scatter, the better the system (within 0.025mm is regarded as good). Tracing light of different colours shows the effect of chromatic abberation.

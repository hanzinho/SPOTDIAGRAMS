# SPOTDIAGRAMS

Some Fortran code to do ray tracing through optical telescope systems.

The end results is a spotdiagram: which is a bunble of parallel incoming light rays that hit the focal point. The smaller the scatter, the better the system. Tracing light of different colours show the effect of chromatic abberation.
